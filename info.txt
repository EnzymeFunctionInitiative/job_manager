Project StructureTo keep the application organized and secure, I'll set up the following directory structure. The core logic will be version-controlled, while the plugins and config will be specific to your environment and should not be checked into version control.hpc_job_manager/

app/: Contains the core application logic.main.py: The entry point of the application.database.py: Handles database connections and sessions.job_handler.py: Contains the logic for processing individual jobs.models.py: Will contain the SQLAlchemy models from your job_efi_web_orm.py.txt file.plugins/: Contains modules for interacting with external systems. This directory should be in your .gitignore.hpc_connector.py:  Will contain the logic for SSH/SCP connections and HPC command execution (e.g., sbatch, sacct).notification.py: Will handle sending email notifications.config/: For application configuration. This should also be in your .gitignore.settings.py: Defines configuration variables like database connection strings, file paths, and HPC details.requirements.txt: Lists the Python dependencies for this project.README.md: Provides instructions on how to set up and run the application.
